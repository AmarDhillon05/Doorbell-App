Code for a app that stores pictures of familiar people's faces in a database, then uses that data to identify whenever they show up on a camera.

Meant to be a doorbell app, but this was mainly to experiment with my early knowledge in computer vision as well as making a python-only gui for the first time.

Uses Kivy for the GUI, and pretrained MTCNN to detect facial features and compare them with cosine similarity to find it two faces are similar. 

Planning on revamping or coming up with a better use case for this (Since it's been 2 years since making it).
